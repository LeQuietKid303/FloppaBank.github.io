      <h1>Different Currencies</h1>
      <p>
        I think this is pretty obvious, but every country has their own Currency, such as USD, EUR, JPY, and many more!<br />
        Now, Currencies are a huge part in our lives, and for granted, jobs. We use Currencies to know how much money we have,<br />
        whether that's in our Currency or another Currency, which can be helpful for traveling, or a guide or possibly even tourist.<br />
        Different places use different terms depending on an item in their Currency, for example, Canada uses the term Toonie for a coin<br />
        that's worth 2 Canadian Dollars, and a Loonie for 1 Canadian Dollar.
